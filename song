WOK EEE HOE O (scat)
Doin on a Saturday night.
I'd rather be sleepin than gettin in a fight.
You rock it to the north.
You rock it to the east.
You rock it all around like a heavy metal beast.
You know, you know, you know you gotta...
You know, you know, you know you gotta...
TAKIN' IT...
TAKIN' IT...EASY!!!
TAKIN' IT...
TAKIN' IT...EASY!!!
